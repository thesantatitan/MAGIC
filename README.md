# MAGIC

This repository contains the code for our PIS course project <a href="https://siddharth19111.wixsite.com/magic">MAGIC</a>

The project uses a nodeMCU board as the microcontroller platform and our application is built in unity.

nodecode_saver is a helper program that saves the data from the wands and nodecode contains code to be used int the application.
All the C# files are to be imported to your unity project and an android application is built with VR enabled in the build settings in unity

We use Vuforia engine for Augmented Reality and therefore it needs to be incldued in your unity build.
